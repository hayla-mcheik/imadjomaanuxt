        Imad Jomaa is a pioneering entrepreneur, investor, and the Founder and President of JGroup, a diversified business group at the forefront of media, advertising, and technology in the MENA region. Since founding the company in 2003, Imad has led JGroup’s transformation from a Beirut-based operation into an internationally recognized ecosystem of subsidiaries, including Promofix, Promomedia, Optiview, and WMS.

Imad holds a Master’s degree in Financial Economics and dual Bachelor’s degrees in Economics and Chemistry from the American University of Beirut (AUB), where he graduated as class valedictorian. Armed with academic excellence and market foresight, he quickly built a reputation for spotting emerging trends and creating opportunities, long before they became mainstream.

Over the past two decades, Imad has positioned JGroup as a regional pioneer in every new wave of innovation, from performance marketing and data-driven media to AI, Web3, and immersive technologies. Under his leadership, JGroup has secured strategic partnerships with global tech giants and ad-tech leaders such as Google, TikTok, Snap, Blis, Criteo, Crimtan, Channel Factory, Amazon, iHeart, and others, powering regional growth through global collaboration.

While JGroup was proudly founded in Lebanon, the company’s regional headquarters has grown to become based in the UAE, reflecting its expanding footprint and future-focused positioning across the Middle East and beyond.

In addition to his corporate leadership, Imad actively represents Lebanese investors in key international economic forums, where he contributes to shaping policies and partnerships that promote collaborative economic growth for the Middle East and beyond.

Imad continues to lead JGroup’s strategic expansion into high-growth verticals and markets, with a focus on innovation, data, and performance. His forward-looking approach, combined with a strong commercial mindset and deep regional expertise, has positioned JGroup as a trusted partner for global platforms and a catalyst for transformation in the digital economy.
